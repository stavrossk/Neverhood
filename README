Neverhood is an open-source, SDL Perl remake of the 1996 "The Neverhood". Not much is done, so don't expect to see anything yet. You can try running this just to see if it works on your system. If it doesn't, please contact me (see contact details below) or open an issue on GitHub (see code repository below).

I also hang out on the SDL IRC, and I might direct you there to chat.

TODO and Milestones for Games::Neverhood
Since 27 Sep 2010

TODO
    Get my SDL changes released and update SDL version in Build.PL
    Complete config mode
    Fix w and h in Drawable
    Make smacker audio resync with video
    Only resume music/sound that you paused
    Music fading code to fade between volumes
    Music fading might sound better if non-linear, use some function?
    Split h and c apart in src/ and use so instead of o
    Rename Drawable and Ticker
    MooseX::Types?

Things I shouldn't forget to thank:

Contributors to SDL Perl, for making it what it is today
As well as specifically FROGGS, kthakore and Alias for their help and/or praise

The ScummVM Neverhood Engine (WIP), providing the basis of all my work

Programs/libraries:
The Neverhood

SDL
libsdl
Notepad++
FRAPS                 being a good lossless capturer and FPS indicator
GIMP                  being good for viewing images
Game Audio Player     extracting all the files from the Neverhood BLBs
SMPlayer              playing the Smacker video
FFmpeg                having the Smacker codec
zlib/contrib/Blast    decompressing PKWARE-compressed files

Websites:
Github            being an amazing hub of the gits
